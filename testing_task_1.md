### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby


#needs relatives required
class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    #should be def check_for_ace(card)
    if card.value = 1
      #should be ==
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  #line should be def highest_card(card1, card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    #should be card1.value() and card2.value()
    return card
    #line should be return card2
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end
#unnecessary end (should only be two)

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  #should be total = 0
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
    #this needs to be outside the for loop and needs a space after of
  end
end
